  "about_service": "MBA, to an Interior designer, to a Home Baker, to a Mindset coach now, and the founder of Sukhaa. It's a whole lot of journey for our founder Deepika. In her own words, I have always been a passionate person and an avid learner. I have never shied away from learning about things that I felt most passionate about and on the way stumbled, got back up, and learned again. I always believe, only when you try out various things in life, can you reach your true calling. And that's how I have become a Mindset coach. And the journey of Sukhaa was always with me but I realized about it a little late. I have always been passionate and picky about the choice of my clothing and styling, which always grabbed eyeballs and appreciation. Also, I am a lover of Indian handloom and handcrafted pieces of our Indian artisans and weavers and food, of course!! So that's how one day I realized to follow this passion and started Sukhaa, wherein I bring to you handpicked pieces from across India.' Every piece at Sukhaa is handpicked by the founder herself so there is total quality assurance. ",
